Description: Simulating species migration and range dynamics under stable or changing environmental conditions based on a simple, raster-based, deterministic or stochastic migration model. Kissmig runs on binary or quantitative suitability maps, which are pre-calculated with niche-based habitat suitability models (also called ecological niche models (ENMs) or species distribution models (SDMs)).
